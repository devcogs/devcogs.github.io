You’ve got an idea for a new website, you know or at least have an idea of what you want it to look like. You know what content you’ll be putting on there, you know what products or services you’ll be selling (if you are). And you think you want to do it all with WordPress.

It turns out that using WordPress is a great decision, it has a vibrant ecosystem and has many plugins already built that can handle almost any idea you can throw at it. If not there are companies, freelancers and more standing by ready to help you bring your idea to life.

### Find the best hosting for your site

Before you can use WordPress (.org) you will need to choose a hosting service. There are many options out there, anything from starter friendly shared hosting, to dedicated servers that will take a lot of time and energy to keep up to date and running properly. There are even free hosting services available, however, I would recommend steering clear of them for various reasons.

### Hosting Options for your site

Choosing the right hosting for your website can be a daunting task and can feel overwhelming. But I am here to help in guiding you to the right decision for your hosting needs. In this post I will layout the various hosting options along with there pros and cons. 

#### Shared Hosting

This is where most new WordPress users start out; including myself. It's very easy to setup and get going with a new WordPress site along with being budget friendly. Most if not all hosting providers offer one-click installation, along with enough storage and bandwidth to handle a new site and often extra perks such as some Google Adwords or Facebook credits. Some offer a free domain but I would recommend being cautious with this as some unscrupulous hosting providers might use this as a way to lock you into their services.

#### Managed VPS (Virtual Private Server)

This is another form of shared hosting but in this case the server is partitioned in such a way that you get a virtual server that you have full control over, or whoever is managing it for you does. The good thing about this is that it's possible to customize it in ways to make your website load much faster and use less resources on the server. Some hosts also offer services such as free migrations and automated backups, which not only give you more bang for you buck but it helps you to move from the starter hosting once you have out grown it.

#### DIY VPS/Dedicated

Another option is to use a VPS hosting provider or buying a dedicated server and doing everything yourself. While this would give you the same amount of control and speed; a con, potentially a huge con is that it will cost you a lot of time to keep everything updated. Also, checking to make sure there aren't any vulnerabilities, making sure the backups worked and that they're a good copy. This will all time away from actually running your website and may end up costing you more than if you just went for the managed hosting to keep you free and clear to do what matters most to your business.

#### Managed WordPress Hosting

The last hosting option I'll cover here is Managed WordPress Hosting, they fully manage everything for you. The server, the WordPress software, they offer support, and much more. Most have an entry level plan that will get you started and keep your site going for awhile as it grows, but once your site starts getting more traffic you'll need most hosting power. Not to worry with the wonderful support these companies offer they'll help you scale up to the next tier seamlessly. 

### Choose a Domain Name

If you already have a name picked out or have a list of ideas, great! If not, there are some great articles available to help in the process of coming up with ideas. 

Once you have some ideas, head over to a domain registrar such as NameCheap or GoDaddy to check if it's available.

After purchasing your perfect domain name, follow your hosting companies instructions on getting it setup. This will probably involve either setting the domains nameservers to that of your hosting company or setting an A and AAAA record, something to consider is if your hosting company support IPv6, the newest internet addressing standard.

### Customizing Your Site Design

WordPress will come with a default theme set but if you had a specific design in mind this might not meet what you were thinking. But don't worry it's easy enough to change your design. There are heaps of free themes available on the official WordPress theme directory and also plenty of premium themes available from various companies and providers around the internet.

### Adding Features with Plugins

Plugins can add many different features to your site. Everything from, spam protection, backing up your site, enhancing your SEO, to adding a storefront so you can sell your products. There are of course many other things that can be done this is just a small sampling.

### Finally it's time to add content

Next in line is creating and adding your content. The WordPress dashboard strives to be user friendly but can be intimidating to new users, but don't worry there are tutorials and videos available to help you on your way to becoming an expert WordPress user.

If you already have existing WordPress content there are tools available to help you import whatever you have from other platforms. If what you need is not available, don't hesitate to ask, there are developers waiting and ready to help you come up with the solution you need to get your new site setup and ready.

### Conclusion

Thank you for reading my post on setting up a new WordPress site, this is by no means a full and complete list at this point but should serve as a good starting point. I plan to use this as a living document that I will keep updating over time to make it much more useful and exhaustive of everything needed to get a new site started.
